      "The United States of America (USA or U.S.A.), commonly known as the United States (US or U.S.) or America, is a country primarily located in North America, between Canada and Mexico. It is a federation of 50 states, a federal capital district (Washington, D.C.), and 326 Indian reservations. Outside the union of states, it asserts sovereignty over five major unincorporated island territories and various uninhabited islands.[j] The country has the world's third-largest land area,[d] largest maritime exclusive economic zone,\n",
      "and the third-largest population, exceeding 334 million.[k]\n",
      "Paleo-Indians migrated across the Bering land bridge more than 12,000 years ago. British colonization led to the first settlement of the Thirteen Colonies in Virginia in 1607. Clashes with the British Crown over taxation and political representation sparked the American Revolution, with the Second Continental Congress formally declaring independence on July 4, 1776. Following its victory in the Revolutionary War (1775â€“1783), the country continued to expand across North America. As more states were admitted, sectional division over slavery led to the secession of the Confederate States of America, which fought the remaining states of the Union during the 1861â€“1865 American Civil War. With the Union's victory and preservation, slavery was abolished nationally. By 1890, the United States had established itself as a great power. After Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, the U.S. entered World War II. The aftermath of the war left the U.S. and the Soviet Union as the world's two superpowers and led to the Cold War, during which both countries engaged in a struggle for ideological dominance and international influence. Following the Soviet Union's collapse and the end of the Cold War in 1991, the U.S. emerged as the world's sole superpower.\n",
      "The U.S. national government is a presidential constitutional republic and liberal democracy with three separate branches: legislative, executive, and judicial. It has a bicameral national legislature composed of the House of Representatives, a lower house based on population; and the Senate, an upper house based on equal representation for each state. Substantial autonomy is given to states and several territories, with a political culture that emphasizes liberty, equality under the law, individualism, and limited government.\n",
      "One of the most developed countries, the U.S. has had the largest nominal GDP in the world since 1890 and accounted for 15% of the global economy in 2023.[l] It possesses by far the largest amount of wealth of any country and the highest median income per capita of any non-microstate. The U.S. ranks among the world's highest in economic competitiveness, productivity, innovation, human rights, and higher education. Its hard power and cultural influence have a global reach. The U.S. is a founding member of the World Bank, IMF, Organization of American States, NATO, World Health Organization, and a permanent member of the UN Security Council.\n",
      "The first documentary evidence of the phrase \"United States of America\" dates back to a letter from January 2, 1776, written by Stephen Moylan, a Continental Army aide to General George Washington, to Joseph Reed, Washington's aide-de-camp. Moylan expressed his desire to go \"with full and ample powers from the United States of America to Spain\" to seek assistance in the Revolutionary War effort.[20][21] The first known publication of the phrase \"United States of America\" was in an anonymous essay in The Virginia Gazette newspaper in Williamsburg, on AprilÂ 6, 1776.[22]\n",
      "By June 1776, the name \"United States of America\" appeared in drafts of the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union, authored by John Dickinson, a Founding Father from the Province of Pennsylvania,[23][24] and in the Declaration of Independence, written primarily by Thomas Jefferson and adopted by the Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia, on July 4, 1776.[23][25]\n",
      "The first inhabitants of North America migrated from Siberia across the Bering land bridge at least 12,000 years ago;[27][28] the Clovis culture, which appeared around 11,000 BC, is believed to be the first widespread culture in the Americas.[29][30] Over time, indigenous North American cultures grew increasingly sophisticated, and some, such as the Mississippian culture, developed agriculture, architecture, and complex societies.[31] Indigenous peoples and cultures such as the Algonquian peoples,[32] Ancestral Puebloans,[33] and the Iroquois developed across the present-day United States.[34] Native population estimates of what is now the United States before the arrival of European immigrants range from around 500,000[35][36] to nearly 10 million.[36][37]\n",
      "Christopher Columbus began exploring the Caribbean in 1492, leading to Spanish settlements in present-day Puerto Rico, Florida, and New Mexico.[38][39][40] France established its own settlements along the Mississippi River and Gulf of Mexico.[41] British colonization of the East Coast began with the Virginia Colony (1607) and Plymouth Colony (1620).[42][43] The Mayflower Compact and the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut established precedents for representative self-governance and constitutionalism that would develop throughout the American colonies.[44][45] While European settlers in what is now the United States experienced conflicts with Native Americans, they also engaged in trade, exchanging European tools for food and animal pelts.[46][m] Relations ranged from close cooperation to warfare and massacres. The colonial authorities often pursued policies that forced Native Americans to adopt European lifestyles, including conversion to Christianity.[50][51] Along the eastern seaboard, settlers trafficked African slaves through the Atlantic slave trade.[52]\n",
      "The original Thirteen Colonies[n] that would later found the United States were administered by Great Britain,[53] and had local governments with elections open to most white male property owners.[54][55] The colonial population grew rapidly, eclipsing Native American populations;[56] by the 1770s, the natural increase of the population was such that only a small minority of Americans had been born overseas.[57] The colonies' distance from Britain allowed for the development of self-governance,[58] and the First Great Awakeningâ€”a series of Christian revivalsâ€”fueled colonial interest in religious liberty.[59]\n",
      "After winning the French and Indian War, Britain began to assert greater control over local colonial affairs, creating colonial political resistance; one of the primary colonial grievances was a denial of their rights as Englishmen, particularly the right to representation in the British government that taxed them. In 1774, the First Continental Congress met in Philadelphia, and passed a colonial boycott of British goods that proved effective. The British attempt to then disarm the colonists resulted in the 1775 Battles of Lexington and Concord, igniting the American Revolutionary War. At the Second Continental Congress, the colonies appointed George Washington commander-in-chief of the Continental Army and created a committee led by Thomas Jefferson to write the Declaration of Independence, adopted on July 4, 1776.[60] The political values of the American Revolution included liberty, inalienable individual rights; and the sovereignty of the people;[61] supporting republicanism and rejecting monarchy, aristocracy, and hereditary political power; virtue and faithfulness in the performance of civic duties; and vilification of corruption.[62] The Founding Fathers of the United States, which included George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson, John Jay, James Madison, Thomas Paine, and John Adams, took inspiration from Ancient Greco-Roman, Renaissance, and Age of Enlightenment philosophies and ideas.[63][64]\n",
      "After the British surrender at the siege of Yorktown in 1781, American sovereignty was internationally recognized by the Treaty of Paris (1783), through which the U.S. gained territory stretching west to the Mississippi River, north to present-day Canada, and south to Spanish Florida.[65] Ratified in 1781, the Articles of Confederation established a decentralized government that operated until 1789.[60] The Northwest Ordinance (1787) established the precedent by which the country's territory would expand with the admission of new states, rather than the expansion of existing states.[66] The U.S. Constitution was drafted at the 1787 Constitutional Convention to overcome the limitations of the Articles; it went into effect in 1789, creating a federation administered by three branches on the principle of checks and balances.[67] Washington was elected the country's first president under the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights was adopted in 1791 to allay concerns by skeptics of the more centralized government;[68][69] his resignations first as commander-in-chief after the Revolution and later as president set a precedent followed by John Adams, establishing the peaceful transfer of power between rival parties.[70][71]\n",
      "In the late 18th century, American settlers began to expand westward, some with a sense of manifest destiny.[72] The Louisiana Purchase (1803) from France nearly doubled the territory of the United States.[73] Lingering issues with Britain remained, leading to the War of 1812, which was fought to a draw.[74] Spain ceded Florida and its Gulf Coast territory in 1819.[75] The Missouri Compromise attempted to balance desires of northern states to prevent expansion of slavery in the country with those of southern states to expand it, admitting Missouri as a slave state and Maine as a free state and declared a policy of prohibiting slavery in the remaining Louisiana Purchase lands north of the 36Â°30â€² parallel.[76] As Americans expanded further into land inhabited by Native Americans, the federal government often applied policies of Indian removal or assimilation.[77][78] The infamous Trail of Tears (1830â€“1850) was a U.S.\n",
      "government policy that forcibly removed and displaced most Native Americans living east of the Mississippi River to lands far to the west. These and earlier organized displacements prompted a long series of American Indian Wars west of the Mississippi.[79][80] The Republic of Texas was annexed in 1845,[81] and the 1846 Oregon Treaty led to U.S. control of the present-day American Northwest.[82] Victory in the Mexicanâ€“American War resulted in the 1848 Mexican Cession of California and much of the present-day American Southwest.[72][83] The California Gold Rush of 1848â€“1849 spurred a huge migration of white settlers to the Pacific coast, leading to even more confrontations with Native populations. One of the most violent, the California genocide of thousands of Native inhabitants, lasted into the early 1870s,[84][85] just as additional western territories and states were created.[86]\n",
      "During the colonial period, slavery was legal in the American colonies, though the practice began to be significantly questioned during the American Revolution.[87] States in The North enacted abolition laws,[88] though support for slavery strengthened in Southern states, as inventions such as the cotton gin made the institution increasingly profitable for Southern elites.[89][90][91] This sectional conflict regarding slavery culminated in the American Civil War (1861â€“1865).[92][93]\n",
      "Eleven slave states seceded and formed the Confederate States of America, while the other states remained in the Union.[94] War broke out in April 1861 after the Confederacy bombarded Fort Sumter.[95] After the January 1863 Emancipation Proclamation, many freed slaves joined the Union Army.[96] The war began to turn in the Union's favor following the 1863 Siege of Vicksburg and Battle of Gettysburg, and the Confederacy surrendered in 1865 after the Union's victory in the Battle of Appomattox Court House.[97]\n",
      "The Reconstruction era followed the war. After the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln, Reconstruction Amendments were passed to protect the rights of African Americans. National infrastructure, including transcontinental telegraph and railroads, spurred growth in the American frontier.[98]\n",
      "From 1865 through 1917 an unprecedented stream of immigrants arrived in the United States, including 24.4 million from Europe.[101] Most came through the port of New York City, and New York City and other large cities on the East Coast became home to large Jewish, Irish, and Italian populations, while many Germans and Central Europeans moved to the Midwest. At the same time, about one million French Canadians migrated from Quebec to New England.[102] During the Great Migration, millions of African Americans left the rural South for urban areas in the North.[103] Alaska was purchased from Russia in 1867.[104]\n",
      "The Compromise of 1877 effectively ended Reconstruction and white supremacists took local control of Southern politics.[105][106] African Americans endured a period of heightened, overt racism following Reconstruction, a time often called the nadir of American race relations.[107][108] A series of Supreme Court decisions, including Plessy v. Ferguson, emptied the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments of their force, allowing Jim Crow laws in the South to remain unchecked, sundown towns in the Midwest, and segregation in cities across the country, which would be reinforced by the policy of redlining later adopted by the federal Home Owners' Loan Corporation.[109]\n",
      "An explosion of technological advancement accompanied by the exploitation of cheap immigrant labor[110] led to rapid economic development during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, allowing the United States to outpace England, France, and Germany combined.[111][112] This fostered the amassing of power by a few prominent industrialists, largely by their formation of trusts and monopolies to prevent competition.[113] Tycoons led the nation's expansion in the railroad, petroleum, and steel industries. The United States emerged as a pioneer of the automotive industry.[114] These changes were accompanied by significant increases in economic inequality, slum conditions, and social unrest, creating the environment for labor unions to begin to flourish.[115][116][117] This period eventually ended with the advent of the Progressive Era, which was characterized by significant reforms.[118][119]\n",
      "Pro-American elements in Hawaii overthrew the Hawaiian monarchy; the islands were annexed in 1898. Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines were ceded by Spain following the Spanishâ€“American War.[120] American Samoa was acquired by the United States in 1900 after the Second Samoan Civil War.[121] The U.S. Virgin Islands were purchased from Denmark in 1917.[122] The United States entered World War I alongside the Allies of World War I, helping to turn the tide against the Central Powers.[123] In 1920, a constitutional amendment granted nationwide women's suffrage.[124] During the 1920s and 30s, radio for mass communication and the invention of early television transformed communications nationwide.[125] The Wall Street Crash of 1929 triggered the Great Depression, which President Franklin D. Roosevelt responded to with New Deal social and economic policies.[126][127]\n",
      "At first neutral during World War II, the U.S. began supplying war materiel to the Allies of World War II in March 1941 and entered the war in December after the Empire of Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor.[128][129] The U.S. developed the first nuclear weapons and used them against the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945, ending the war.[130][131] The United States was one of the \"Four Policemen\" who met to plan the postwar world, alongside the United Kingdom, Soviet Union, and China.[132][133] The U.S. emerged relatively unscathed from the war, with even greater economic and international political influence.[134]\n",
      "After World War II, the United States entered the Cold War, where geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and the Soviet Union led the two countries to dominate world affairs.[135] The U.S. engaged in regime change against governments perceived to be aligned with the Soviet Union, and competed in the Space Race, culminating in the first crewed Moon landing in 1969.[136][137][138][139]\n",
      "Domestically, the U.S. experienced economic growth, urbanization, and population growth following World War II.[140] The civil rights movement emerged, with Martin Luther King Jr. becoming a prominent leader in the early 1960s.[141] The Great Society plan of President Lyndon Johnson's administration resulted in groundbreaking and broad-reaching laws, policies and a constitutional amendment to counteract some of the worst effects of lingering institutional racism.[142] The counterculture movement in the U.S. brought significant social changes, including the liberalization of attitudes toward recreational drug use and sexuality. It also encouraged open defiance of the military draft (leading to the end of conscription in 1973) and wide opposition to U.S. intervention in Vietnam (with the U.S. totally withdrawing in 1975).[143][144][145] The societal shift in the roles of women partly resulted in large increases in female labor participation in the 1970s, and by 1985 the majority of women aged 16 and older were employed.[146] The late 1980s and early 1990s saw the collapse of the Warsaw Pact and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, which marked the end of the Cold War and solidified the U.S. as the world's sole superpower.[147][148][149][150]\n",
      "The 1990s saw the longest recorded economic expansion in American history, a dramatic decline in crime, and advances in technology, with the World Wide Web, the evolution of the Pentium microprocessor in accordance with Moore's law, rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, the first gene therapy trial, and cloning all emerging and being improved upon throughout the decade. The Human Genome Project was formally launched in 1990, while Nasdaq became the first stock market in the United States to trade online in 1998.[151] In 1991, an American-led international coalition of states expelled an Iraqi invasion force from Kuwait in the Gulf War.[152]\n",
      "The September 11, 2001 attacks by the pan-Islamist militant organization Al-Qaeda led to the war on terror and subsequent military interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq.[153][154] The cultural impact of the attacks was profound and long-lasting.\n",
      "The U.S. housing bubble culminated in 2007 with the Great Recession, the largest economic contraction since the Great Depression.[155] Coming to a head in the 2010s, political polarization increased as sociopolitical debates on cultural issues dominated politics.[156] This polarization was capitalized upon in the January 2021 Capitol attack,[157] when a mob of protesters entered the U.S. Capitol building and attempted to prevent the peaceful transfer of power.[158]\n",
      "The United States is the world's third-largest country by total area behind Russia and Canada.[d][159][160] The 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia occupy a combined area of 3,119,885 square miles (8,080,470Â km2).[161][162] The coastal plain of the Atlantic seaboard gives way to inland forests and rolling hills in the Piedmont plateau region.[163]\n",
      "The Appalachian Mountains and the Adirondack massif separate the East Coast from the Great Lakes and the grasslands of the Midwest.[164] The Mississippi River Systemâ€”the world's fourth longest river systemâ€”runs mainly northâ€“south through the heart of the country. The flat, fertile prairie of the Great Plains stretches to the west, interrupted by a highland region in the southeast.[164]\n",
      "The Rocky Mountains, west of the Great Plains, extend north to south across the country, peaking at over 14,000 feet (4,300Â m) in Colorado.[165] Farther west are the rocky Great Basin and Chihuahua, Sonoran, and Mojave deserts.[166] In the northwest corner of Arizona, carved by the Colorado River over millions of years, is the Grand Canyon, a steep-sided canyon and popular tourist destination known for its overwhelming visual size and intricate, colorful landscape.\n",
      "The Sierra Nevada and Cascade mountain ranges run close to the Pacific coast. The lowest and highest points in the contiguous United States are in the state of California,[167] about 84 miles (135Â km) apart.[168] At an elevation of 20,310 feet (6,190.5Â m), Alaska's Denali is the highest peak in the country and continent.[169] Active volcanoes are common throughout Alaska's Alexander and Aleutian Islands, and Hawaii consists of volcanic islands. The supervolcano underlying Yellowstone National Park in the Rockies is the continent's largest volcanic feature.[170] In 2021, the United States had 8% of global permanent meadows and pastures and 10% of cropland.[171]\n",
      "With its large size and geographic variety, the United States includes most climate types. East of the 100th meridian, the climate ranges from humid continental in the north to humid subtropical in the south.[172] The western Great Plains are semi-arid. Many mountainous areas of the American West have an alpine climate. The climate is arid in the Southwest, Mediterranean in coastal California, and oceanic in coastal Oregon, Washington, and southern Alaska. Most of Alaska is subarctic or polar. Hawaii and the southern tip of Florida are tropical, as well as its territories in the Caribbean and the Pacific.[173]\n",
      "States bordering the Gulf of Mexico are prone to hurricanes, and most of the world's tornadoes occur in the country, mainly in Tornado Alley.[174] Overall, the United States receives more high-impact extreme weather incidents than any other country.[175] Extreme weather became more frequent in the U.S. in the 21st century, with three times the number of reported heat waves as in the 1960s. In the American Southwest, droughts became more persistent and more severe.[176]\n",
      "\n",
      "The U.S. is one of 17 megadiverse countries containing large numbers of endemic species: about 17,000 species of vascular plants occur in the contiguous United States and Alaska, and over 1,800 species of flowering plants are found in Hawaii, few of which occur on the mainland.[178] The United States is home to 428 mammal species, 784 birds, 311 reptiles, 295 amphibians,[179] and 91,000 insect species.[180]\n",
      "There are 63 national parks, and hundreds of other federally managed parks, forests, and wilderness areas, managed by the National Park Service and other agencies.[181] About 28% of the country's land is publicly owned and federally managed,[182] primarily in the western states.[183] Most of this land is protected, though some is leased for commercial use, and less than one percent is used for military purposes.[184][185]\n",
      "Environmental issues in the United States include debates on non-renewable resources and nuclear energy, air and water pollution, biodiversity, logging and deforestation,[186][187] and climate change.[188][189] The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is the federal agency charged with addressing most environmental-related issues.[190] The idea of wilderness has shaped the management of public lands since 1964, with the Wilderness Act.[191] The Endangered Species Act of 1973 provides a way to protect threatened and endangered species and their habitats. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service implements and enforces the Act.[192] As of 2022[update], the U.S. ranked 43rd among 180 countries in the Environmental Performance Index.[193] The country joined the Paris Agreement on climate change in 2016 and has many other environmental commitments.[194]\n",
      "The United States is a federal republic of 50 states, with its capital in a federal district, asserting sovereignty over five unincorporated territories and several uninhabited island possessions (some of which are disputed).[195][196] It is the world's oldest surviving federation, and, according to the World Economic Forum, the oldest democracy as well.[197] It is a liberal representative democracy \"in which majority rule is tempered by minority rights protected by law.\"[198] The Constitution of the United States serves as the country's supreme legal document, also establishing the structure and responsibilities of the national federal government and its relationship with the individual states.[199]\n",
      "Composed of three branches, all headquartered in Washington, D.C., the federal government is the national government of the United States. It is regulated by a strong system of checks and balances.[200]\n",
      "The three-branch system is known as the presidential system, in contrast to the parliamentary system, where the executive is part of the legislative body. Many countries around the world copied this aspect of the 1789 Constitution of the United States, especially in the Americas.[208]\n",
      "The Constitution is silent on political parties. However, they developed independently in the 18th century with the Federalist and Anti-Federalist parties.[209] Since then, the United States has operated as a de facto two-party system, though the parties in that system have been different at different times.\n",
      "The two main national parties are presently the Democratic and the Republican. The former is perceived as relatively liberal in its political platform while the latter is perceived as relatively conservative.[210] Each has a primary system to nominate a presidential ticket, and each runs candidates for other offices in every state in the Union. Other smaller and less influential parties exist but do not have the national scope and breadth of the two main parties.\n",
      "In the American federal system, sovereign powers are shared between two levels of elected government: national and state. People in the states are also represented by local elected governments, which are administrative divisions of the states.[211] States are subdivided into counties or county equivalents, and further divided into municipalities. The District of Columbia is a federal district that contains the capital of the United States, the city of Washington.[212] The territories and the District of Columbia are administrative divisions of the federal government.[213] Federally recognized tribes govern 326[214] Indian reservations.\n",
      "The United States has an established structure of foreign relations, and it has the world's second-largest diplomatic corps as of 2024[update]. It is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council,[215] and home to the United Nations headquarters.[216] The United States is a member of the G7,[217] G20,[218] and OECD intergovernmental organizations.[219] Almost all countries have embassies and many have consulates (official representatives) in the country. Likewise, nearly all countries host formal diplomatic missions with the United States, except Iran,[220] North Korea,[221] and Bhutan.[222] Though Taiwan does not have formal diplomatic relations with the U.S., it maintains close unofficial relations.[223] The United States regularly supplies Taiwan with military equipment to deter potential Chinese aggression.[224] Its geopolitical attention also turned to the Indo-Pacific when the United States joined the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue with Australia, India, and Japan.[225]\n",
      "The United States has a \"Special Relationship\" with the United Kingdom[226] and strong ties with Canada,[227] Australia,[228] New Zealand,[229] the Philippines,[230] Japan,[231] South Korea,[232] Israel,[233] and several European Union countries (France, Italy, Germany, Spain, and Poland).[234] The U.S. works closely with its NATO allies on military and national security issues, and with countries in the Americas through the Organization of American States and the United Statesâ€“Mexicoâ€“Canada Free Trade Agreement. In South America, Colombia is traditionally considered to be the closest ally of the United States.[235] The U.S. exercises full international defense authority and responsibility for Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau through the Compact of Free Association.[236] It has increasingly conducted strategic cooperation with India,[237] but its ties with China have steadily deteriorated.[238][239] Since 2014, the U.S. has become a key ally of Ukraine;[240] it has also provided the country with significant military equipment and other support in response to Russia's 2022 invasion.[241]\n",
      "The President is the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces and appoints its leaders, the secretary of defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The Department of Defense, which is headquartered at the Pentagon near Washington, D.C., administers five of the six service branches, which are made up of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Space Force. The Coast Guard is administered by the Department of Homeland Security in peacetime and can be transferred to the Department of the Navy in wartime.[242]\n",
      "The United States spent $877 billion on its military in 2022, which is by far the largest amount of any country, making up 39% of global military spending and accounting for 3.5% of the country's GDP.[243][244] The U.S. has 45% of the world's nuclear weapons, the second-largest amount after Russia.[245]\n",
      "The United States has the third-largest combined armed forces in the world, behind the Chinese People's Liberation Army and Indian Armed Forces.[246] The military operates about 800 bases and facilities abroad,[247] and maintains deployments greater than 100 active duty personnel in 25 foreign countries.[248]\n",

      "American primary and secondary education (known in the U.S. as K-12, \"kindergarten through 12th grade\") is decentralized. It is operated by state, territorial, and sometimes municipal governments and regulated by the U.S. Department of Education. In general, children are required to attend school or an approved homeschool from the age of five or six (kindergarten or first grade) until they are 18 years old. This often brings students through the 12th grade, the final year of a U.S. high school, but some states and territories allow them to leave school earlier, at age 16 or 17.[383] The U.S. spends more on education per student than any country in the world,[384] an average of $12,794 per year per public elementary and secondary school student in 2016â€“2017.[385] Among Americans age 25 and older, 84.6% graduated from high school, 52.6% attended some college, 27.2% earned a bachelor's degree, and 9.6% earned a graduate degree.[386] The U.S. literacy rate is near-universal.[159][387] The country has the most Nobel Prize winners in history, with 411 (having won 413 awards).[388][389]\n",

The American Dream, or the perception that Americans enjoy high social mobility, plays a key role in attracting immigrants.[412] Whether this perception is accurate has been a topic of debate.[413][414][415] While mainstream culture holds that the United States is a classless society,[416] scholars identify significant differences between the country's social classes, affecting socialization, language, and values.[417] Americans tend to greatly value socioeconomic achievement, but being ordinary or average is promoted by some as a noble condition as well.[418]\n",

An important cultural export during the Jazz Age, these writings were a key influence on the nÃ©gritude philosophy.[444][445] In the 1950s, an ideal of homogeneity led many authors to attempt to write the Great American Novel,[446] while the Beat Generation rejected this conformity, using styles that elevated the impact of the spoken word over mechanics to describe drug use, sexuality, and the failings of society.[447][448] Contemporary literature is more pluralistic than in previous eras, with the closest thing to a unifying feature being a trend toward self-conscious experiments with language.[449]\n",

Minstrel shows incorporating the instrument into their acts led to its increased popularity and widespread production in the 19th century.[472][473] The electric guitar, first invented in the 1930s, and mass-produced by the 1940s, had an enormous influence on popular music, in particular due to the development of rock and roll.[474]\n",

Jazz grew from blues and ragtime in the early 20th century, developing from the innovations and recordings of composers such as W.C. Handy and Jelly Roll Morton. Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington increased its popularity early in the 20th century.[475] Country music developed in the 1920s,[476] rock and roll in the 1930s,[474] and bluegrass[477] and rhythm and blues in the 1940s.[478] In the 1960s, Bob Dylan emerged from the folk revival to become one of the country's most celebrated songwriters.[479] The musical forms of punk and hip hop both originated in the United States in the 1970s.[480]\n",

Early settlers and later immigrants combined these with foods they were familiar with, such as wheat flour,[509] beef, and milk to create a distinctive American cuisine.[510][511] New World crops, especially pumpkin, corn, potatoes, and turkey as the main course are part of a shared national menu on Thanksgiving, when many Americans prepare or purchase traditional dishes to celebrate the occasion.[512]\n",
      "Characteristic American dishes such as apple pie, fried chicken, doughnuts, french fries, macaroni and cheese, ice cream, pizza, hamburgers, and hot dogs derive from the recipes of various immigrant groups.[513][514][515][516] Mexican dishes such as burritos and tacos preexisted the United States in areas later annexed from Mexico, and adaptations of Chinese cuisine as well as pasta dishes freely adapted from Italian sources are all widely consumed.[517] American chefs have had a significant impact on society both domestically and internationally. In 1946, the Culinary Institute of America was founded by Katharine Angell and Frances Roth. This would become the United States' most prestigious culinary school, where many of the most talented American chefs would study prior to successful careers.[518][519]\n",
      "The United States restaurant industry was projected at $899 billion in sales for 2020,[520][521] and employed more than 15 million people, representing 10% of the nation's workforce directly.[520] It is the country's second-largest private employer and the third-largest employer overall.[522][523] The United States is home to over 220 Michelin Star rated restaurants, 70 of which are in New York City alone.[524] Wine has been produced in what is now the United States since the 1500s, with the first widespread production beginning in what is now New Mexico in 1628.[525][526][527] Today, wine production is undertaken in all fifty states, with California producing 84 percent of all US wine. With more than 1,100,000 acres (4,500Â km2) under vine, the United States is the fourth-largest wine producing country in the world, after Italy, Spain, and France.[528][529]\n",
      "The American fast-food industry, the world's first and largest, pioneered the drive-through format in the 1940s[530] and is often viewed as being a symbol of U.S. marketing dominance. American companies such as McDonald's,[531] Burger King, Pizza Hut, Kentucky Fried Chicken, and Domino's Pizza, among many others, have numerous outlets around the world.[532]\n",
      "The most popular spectator sports in the U.S. are American football, basketball, baseball, soccer, and ice hockey.[533] While most major U.S. sports such as baseball and American football have evolved out of European practices, basketball, volleyball, skateboarding, and snowboarding are American inventions, many of which have become popular worldwide.[534] Lacrosse and surfing arose from Native American and Native Hawaiian activities that predate European contact.[535] The market for professional sports in the United States was approximately $69Â billion in July 2013, roughly 50% larger than that of all of Europe, the Middle East, and Africa combined.[536]\n",
      "American football is by several measures the most popular spectator sport in the United States;[537] the National Football League has the highest average attendance of any sports league in the world, and the Super Bowl is watched by tens of millions globally.[538] However, baseball has been regarded as the U.S. \"national sport\" since the late 19th century. After American football, the next four most popular professional team sports are basketball, baseball, soccer, and ice hockey. Their premier leagues are, respectively, the National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball, Major League Soccer, and the National Hockey League. The most-watched individual sports in the U.S. are golf and auto racing, particularly NASCAR and IndyCar.[539][540]\n",
      "On the collegiate level, earnings for the member institutions exceed $1 billion annually,[541] and college football and basketball attract large audiences, as the NCAA March Madness tournament and the College Football Playoff are some of the most watched national sporting events.[542] In the U.S., the intercollegiate sports level serves as a feeder system for professional sports. This differs greatly from practices in nearly all other countries, where publicly and privately funded sports organizations serve this function.[543]\n",
      "Eight Olympic Games have taken place in the United States. The 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis, Missouri, were the first-ever Olympic Games held outside of Europe.[544] The Olympic Games will be held in the U.S. for a ninth time when Los Angeles hosts the 2028 Summer Olympics. U.S. athletes have won a total of 2,959 medals (1,173 gold) at the Olympic Games, the most of any country.[545][546][547]\n",
      "In international competition, the U.S. men's national soccer team has qualified for eleven World Cups, while the women's national team has won the FIFA Women's World Cup and Olympic soccer tournament four times each.[548] The United States hosted the 1994 FIFA World Cup and will co-host, along with Canada and Mexico, the 2026 FIFA World Cup.[549] The 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup was also hosted by the United States. Its final match was watched by 90,185, setting the world record for most-attended women's sporting event.[550]\n",

      "The United States of America (USA or U.S.A.), commonly known as the United States (US or U.S.) or America, is a country primarily located in North America, between Canada and Mexico. It is a federation of 50 states, a federal capital district (Washington, D.C.), and 326 Indian reservations. Outside the union of states, it asserts sovereignty over five major unincorporated island territories and various uninhabited islands.[j] The country has the world's third-largest land area,[d] largest maritime exclusive economic zone,\n",

      "Paleo-Indians migrated across the Bering land bridge more than 12,000 years ago. British colonization led to the first settlement of the Thirteen Colonies in Virginia in 1607. Clashes with the British Crown over taxation and political representation sparked the American Revolution, with the Second Continental Congress formally declaring independence on July 4, 1776. Following its victory in the Revolutionary War (1775â€“1783), the country continued to expand across North America. As more states were admitted, sectional division over slavery led to the secession of the Confederate States of America, which fought the remaining states of the Union during the 1861â€“1865 American Civil War. With the Union's victory and preservation, slavery was abolished nationally. By 1890, the United States had established itself as a great power. After Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, the U.S. entered World War II. The aftermath of the war left the U.S. and the Soviet Union as the world's two superpowers and led to the Cold War, during which both countries engaged in a struggle for ideological dominance and international influence. Following the Soviet Union's collapse and the end of the Cold War in 1991, the U.S. emerged as the world's sole superpower.\n",
      "The U.S. national government is a presidential constitutional republic and liberal democracy with three separate branches: legislative, executive, and judicial. It has a bicameral national legislature composed of the House of Representatives, a lower house based on population; and the Senate, an upper house based on equal representation for each state. Substantial autonomy is given to states and several territories, with a political culture that emphasizes liberty, equality under the law, individualism, and limited government.\n",
      "One of the most developed countries, the U.S. has had the largest nominal GDP in the world since 1890 and accounted for 15% of the global economy in 2023.[l] It possesses by far the largest amount of wealth of any country and the highest median income per capita of any non-microstate. The U.S. ranks among the world's highest in economic competitiveness, productivity, innovation, human rights, and higher education. Its hard power and cultural influence have a global reach. The U.S. is a founding member of the World Bank, IMF, Organization of American States, NATO, World Health Organization, and a permanent member of the UN Security Council.\n",
      "The first documentary evidence of the phrase \"United States of America\" dates back to a letter from January 2, 1776, written by Stephen Moylan, a Continental Army aide to General George Washington, to Joseph Reed, Washington's aide-de-camp. Moylan expressed his desire to go \"with full and ample powers from the United States of America to Spain\" to seek assistance in the Revolutionary War effort.[20][21] The first known publication of the phrase \"United States of America\" was in an anonymous essay in The Virginia Gazette newspaper in Williamsburg, on AprilÂ 6, 1776.[22]\n",
      "By June 1776, the name \"United States of America\" appeared in drafts of the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union, authored by John Dickinson, a Founding Father from the Province of Pennsylvania,[23][24] and in the Declaration of Independence, written primarily by Thomas Jefferson and adopted by the Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia, on July 4, 1776.[23][25]\n",
      "The first inhabitants of North America migrated from Siberia across the Bering land bridge at least 12,000 years ago;[27][28] the Clovis culture, which appeared around 11,000 BC, is believed to be the first widespread culture in the Americas.[29][30] Over time, indigenous North American cultures grew increasingly sophisticated, and some, such as the Mississippian culture, developed agriculture, architecture, and complex societies.[31] Indigenous peoples and cultures such as the Algonquian peoples,[32] Ancestral Puebloans,[33] and the Iroquois developed across the present-day United States.[34] Native population estimates of what is now the United States before the arrival of European immigrants range from around 500,000[35][36] to nearly 10 million.[36][37]\n",
      "Christopher Columbus began exploring the Caribbean in 1492, leading to Spanish settlements in present-day Puerto Rico, Florida, and New Mexico.[38][39][40] France established its own settlements along the Mississippi River and Gulf of Mexico.[41] British colonization of the East Coast began with the Virginia Colony (1607) and Plymouth Colony (1620).[42][43] The Mayflower Compact and the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut established precedents for representative self-governance and constitutionalism that would develop throughout the American colonies.[44][45] While European settlers in what is now the United States experienced conflicts with Native Americans, they also engaged in trade, exchanging European tools for food and animal pelts.[46][m] Relations ranged from close cooperation to warfare and massacres. The colonial authorities often pursued policies that forced Native Americans to adopt European lifestyles, including conversion to Christianity.[50][51] Along the eastern seaboard, settlers trafficked African slaves through the Atlantic slave trade.[52]\n",
      "The original Thirteen Colonies[n] that would later found the United States were administered by Great Britain,[53] and had local governments with elections open to most white male property owners.[54][55] The colonial population grew rapidly, eclipsing Native American populations;[56] by the 1770s, the natural increase of the population was such that only a small minority of Americans had been born overseas.[57] The colonies' distance from Britain allowed for the development of self-governance,[58] and the First Great Awakeningâ€”a series of Christian revivalsâ€”fueled colonial interest in religious liberty.[59]\n",
      "After winning the French and Indian War, Britain began to assert greater control over local colonial affairs, creating colonial political resistance; one of the primary colonial grievances was a denial of their rights as Englishmen, particularly the right to representation in the British government that taxed them. In 1774, the First Continental Congress met in Philadelphia, and passed a colonial boycott of British goods that proved effective. The British attempt to then disarm the colonists resulted in the 1775 Battles of Lexington and Concord, igniting the American Revolutionary War. At the Second Continental Congress, the colonies appointed George Washington commander-in-chief of the Continental Army and created a committee led by Thomas Jefferson to write the Declaration of Independence, adopted on July 4, 1776.[60] The political values of the American Revolution included liberty, inalienable individual rights; and the sovereignty of the people;[61] supporting republicanism and rejecting monarchy, aristocracy, and hereditary political power; virtue and faithfulness in the performance of civic duties; and vilification of corruption.[62] The Founding Fathers of the United States, which included George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson, John Jay, James Madison, Thomas Paine, and John Adams, took inspiration from Ancient Greco-Roman, Renaissance, and Age of Enlightenment philosophies and ideas.[63][64]\n",
      "After the British surrender at the siege of Yorktown in 1781, American sovereignty was internationally recognized by the Treaty of Paris (1783), through which the U.S. gained territory stretching west to the Mississippi River, north to present-day Canada, and south to Spanish Florida.[65] Ratified in 1781, the Articles of Confederation established a decentralized government that operated until 1789.[60] The Northwest Ordinance (1787) established the precedent by which the country's territory would expand with the admission of new states, rather than the expansion of existing states.[66] The U.S. Constitution was drafted at the 1787 Constitutional Convention to overcome the limitations of the Articles; it went into effect in 1789, creating a federation administered by three branches on the principle of checks and balances.[67] Washington was elected the country's first president under the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights was adopted in 1791 to allay concerns by skeptics of the more centralized government;[68][69] his resignations first as commander-in-chief after the Revolution and later as president set a precedent followed by John Adams, establishing the peaceful transfer of power between rival parties.[70][71]\n",
      "In the late 18th century, American settlers began to expand westward, some with a sense of manifest destiny.[72] The Louisiana Purchase (1803) from France nearly doubled the territory of the United States.[73] Lingering issues with Britain remained, leading to the War of 1812, which was fought to a draw.[74] Spain ceded Florida and its Gulf Coast territory in 1819.[75] The Missouri Compromise attempted to balance desires of northern states to prevent expansion of slavery in the country with those of southern states to expand it, admitting Missouri as a slave state and Maine as a free state and declared a policy of prohibiting slavery in the remaining Louisiana Purchase lands north of the 36Â°30â€² parallel.[76] As Americans expanded further into land inhabited by Native Americans, the federal government often applied policies of Indian removal or assimilation.[77][78] The infamous Trail of Tears (1830â€“1850) was a U.S.\n",
      "government policy that forcibly removed and displaced most Native Americans living east of the Mississippi River to lands far to the west. These and earlier organized displacements prompted a long series of American Indian Wars west of the Mississippi.[79][80] The Republic of Texas was annexed in 1845,[81] and the 1846 Oregon Treaty led to U.S. control of the present-day American Northwest.[82] Victory in the Mexicanâ€“American War resulted in the 1848 Mexican Cession of California and much of the present-day American Southwest.[72][83] The California Gold Rush of 1848â€“1849 spurred a huge migration of white settlers to the Pacific coast, leading to even more confrontations with Native populations. One of the most violent, the California genocide of thousands of Native inhabitants, lasted into the early 1870s,[84][85] just as additional western territories and states were created.[86]\n",
      "During the colonial period, slavery was legal in the American colonies, though the practice began to be significantly questioned during the American Revolution.[87] States in The North enacted abolition laws,[88] though support for slavery strengthened in Southern states, as inventions such as the cotton gin made the institution increasingly profitable for Southern elites.[89][90][91] This sectional conflict regarding slavery culminated in the American Civil War (1861â€“1865).[92][93]\n",
      "Eleven slave states seceded and formed the Confederate States of America, while the other states remained in the Union.[94] War broke out in April 1861 after the Confederacy bombarded Fort Sumter.[95] After the January 1863 Emancipation Proclamation, many freed slaves joined the Union Army.[96] The war began to turn in the Union's favor following the 1863 Siege of Vicksburg and Battle of Gettysburg, and the Confederacy surrendered in 1865 after the Union's victory in the Battle of Appomattox Court House.[97]\n",
      "The Reconstruction era followed the war. After the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln, Reconstruction Amendments were passed to protect the rights of African Americans. National infrastructure, including transcontinental telegraph and railroads, spurred growth in the American frontier.[98]\n",
      "From 1865 through 1917 an unprecedented stream of immigrants arrived in the United States, including 24.4 million from Europe.[101] Most came through the port of New York City, and New York City and other large cities on the East Coast became home to large Jewish, Irish, and Italian populations, while many Germans and Central Europeans moved to the Midwest. At the same time, about one million French Canadians migrated from Quebec to New England.[102] During the Great Migration, millions of African Americans left the rural South for urban areas in the North.[103] Alaska was purchased from Russia in 1867.[104]\n",
      "The Compromise of 1877 effectively ended Reconstruction and white supremacists took local control of Southern politics.[105][106] African Americans endured a period of heightened, overt racism following Reconstruction, a time often called the nadir of American race relations.[107][108] A series of Supreme Court decisions, including Plessy v. Ferguson, emptied the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments of their force, allowing Jim Crow laws in the South to remain unchecked, sundown towns in the Midwest, and segregation in cities across the country, which would be reinforced by the policy of redlining later adopted by the federal Home Owners' Loan Corporation.[109]\n",
      "An explosion of technological advancement accompanied by the exploitation of cheap immigrant labor[110] led to rapid economic development during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, allowing the United States to outpace England, France, and Germany combined.[111][112] This fostered the amassing of power by a few prominent industrialists, largely by their formation of trusts and monopolies to prevent competition.[113] Tycoons led the nation's expansion in the railroad, petroleum, and steel industries. The United States emerged as a pioneer of the automotive industry.[114] These changes were accompanied by significant increases in economic inequality, slum conditions, and social unrest, creating the environment for labor unions to begin to flourish.[115][116][117] This period eventually ended with the advent of the Progressive Era, which was characterized by significant reforms.[118][119]\n",
      "Pro-American elements in Hawaii overthrew the Hawaiian monarchy; the islands were annexed in 1898. Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines were ceded by Spain following the Spanishâ€“American War.[120] American Samoa was acquired by the United States in 1900 after the Second Samoan Civil War.[121] The U.S. Virgin Islands were purchased from Denmark in 1917.[122] The United States entered World War I alongside the Allies of World War I, helping to turn the tide against the Central Powers.[123] In 1920, a constitutional amendment granted nationwide women's suffrage.[124] During the 1920s and 30s, radio for mass communication and the invention of early television transformed communications nationwide.[125] The Wall Street Crash of 1929 triggered the Great Depression, which President Franklin D. Roosevelt responded to with New Deal social and economic policies.[126][127]\n",
      "At first neutral during World War II, the U.S. began supplying war materiel to the Allies of World War II in March 1941 and entered the war in December after the Empire of Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor.[128][129] The U.S. developed the first nuclear weapons and used them against the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945, ending the war.[130][131] The United States was one of the \"Four Policemen\" who met to plan the postwar world, alongside the United Kingdom, Soviet Union, and China.[132][133] The U.S. emerged relatively unscathed from the war, with even greater economic and international political influence.[134]\n",
      "After World War II, the United States entered the Cold War, where geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and the Soviet Union led the two countries to dominate world affairs.[135] The U.S. engaged in regime change against governments perceived to be aligned with the Soviet Union, and competed in the Space Race, culminating in the first crewed Moon landing in 1969.[136][137][138][139]\n",
      "Domestically, the U.S. experienced economic growth, urbanization, and population growth following World War II.[140] The civil rights movement emerged, with Martin Luther King Jr. becoming a prominent leader in the early 1960s.[141] The Great Society plan of President Lyndon Johnson's administration resulted in groundbreaking and broad-reaching laws, policies and a constitutional amendment to counteract some of the worst effects of lingering institutional racism.[142] The counterculture movement in the U.S. brought significant social changes, including the liberalization of attitudes toward recreational drug use and sexuality. It also encouraged open defiance of the military draft (leading to the end of conscription in 1973) and wide opposition to U.S. intervention in Vietnam (with the U.S. totally withdrawing in 1975).[143][144][145] The societal shift in the roles of women partly resulted in large increases in female labor participation in the 1970s, and by 1985 the majority of women aged 16 and older were employed.[146] The late 1980s and early 1990s saw the collapse of the Warsaw Pact and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, which marked the end of the Cold War and solidified the U.S. as the world's sole superpower.[147][148][149][150]\n",
      "The 1990s saw the longest recorded economic expansion in American history, a dramatic decline in crime, and advances in technology, with the World Wide Web, the evolution of the Pentium microprocessor in accordance with Moore's law, rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, the first gene therapy trial, and cloning all emerging and being improved upon throughout the decade. The Human Genome Project was formally launched in 1990, while Nasdaq became the first stock market in the United States to trade online in 1998.[151] In 1991, an American-led international coalition of states expelled an Iraqi invasion force from Kuwait in the Gulf War.[152]\n",
      "The September 11, 2001 attacks by the pan-Islamist militant organization Al-Qaeda led to the war on terror and subsequent military interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq.[153][154] The cultural impact of the attacks was profound and long-lasting.\n",
      "The U.S. housing bubble culminated in 2007 with the Great Recession, the largest economic contraction since the Great Depression.[155] Coming to a head in the 2010s, political polarization increased as sociopolitical debates on cultural issues dominated politics.[156] This polarization was capitalized upon in the January 2021 Capitol attack,[157] when a mob of protesters entered the U.S. Capitol building and attempted to prevent the peaceful transfer of power.[158]\n",

Many mountainous areas of the American West have an alpine climate. The climate is arid in the Southwest, Mediterranean in coastal California, and oceanic in coastal Oregon, Washington, and southern Alaska. Most of Alaska is subarctic or polar. Hawaii and the southern tip of Florida are tropical, as well as its territories in the Caribbean and the Pacific.[173]\n",

The American Dream, or the perception that Americans enjoy high social mobility, plays a key role in attracting immigrants.[412] Whether this perception is accurate has been a topic of debate.[413][414][415] While mainstream culture holds that the United States is a classless society,[416] scholars identify significant differences between the country's social classes, affecting socialization, language, and values.[417] Americans tend to greatly value socioeconomic achievement, but being ordinary or average is promoted by some as a noble condition as well.[418]\n",

An important cultural export during the Jazz Age, these writings were a key influence on the nÃ©gritude philosophy.[444][445] In the 1950s, an ideal of homogeneity led many authors to attempt to write the Great American Novel,[446] while the Beat Generation rejected this conformity, using styles that elevated the impact of the spoken word over mechanics to describe drug use, sexuality, and the failings of society.[447][448] Contemporary literature is more pluralistic than in previous eras, with the closest thing to a unifying feature being a trend toward self-conscious experiments with language.[449]\n",

Jazz grew from blues and ragtime in the early 20th century, developing from the innovations and recordings of composers such as W.C. Handy and Jelly Roll Morton. Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington increased its popularity early in the 20th century.[475] Country music developed in the 1920s,[476] rock and roll in the 1930s,[474] and bluegrass[477] and rhythm and blues in the 1940s.[478] In the 1960s, Bob Dylan emerged from the folk revival to become one of the country's most celebrated songwriters.[479] The musical forms of punk and hip hop both originated in the United States in the 1970s.[480]\n",
      "The United States has the world's largest music market with a total retail value of $15.9 billion in 2022.[481] Most of the world's major record companies are based in the U.S.; they are represented by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[482] Mid-20th-century American pop stars, such as Frank Sinatra[483] and Elvis Presley,[484] became global celebrities and best-selling music artists,[475] as have artists of the late 20th century, such as Michael Jackson,[485] Madonna,[486] Whitney Houston,[487] and Prince,[488] and of early 21st century such as Taylor Swift and BeyoncÃ©.[489]\n",
      "The United States and China collectively account for the majority of global apparel demand. Apart from professional business attire, American fashion is eclectic and predominantly informal. While Americans' diverse cultural roots are reflected in their clothing, sneakers, jeans, T-shirts, and baseball caps are emblematic of American styles.[490] New York is considered to be one of the \"big four\" global fashion capitals, along with Paris, Milan, and London. A study demonstrated that general proximity to Manhattan's Garment District has been synonymous with American fashion since its inception in the early 20th century.[491]\n",
      "The headquarters of many designer labels reside in Manhattan. Labels cater to niche markets, such as pre teens. There has been a trend in the United States fashion towards sustainable clothing.[492] New York Fashion Week is one of the most influential fashion weeks in the world, and occurs twice a year.[493]\n",
      "The U.S. film industry has a worldwide influence and following. Hollywood, a district in northern Los Angeles, the nation's second-most populous city, is also metonymous for the American filmmaking industry, the third-largest in the world, following India and Nigeria.[494][495][496] The major film studios of the United States are the primary source of the most commercially successful and most ticket-selling movies in the world.[497][498] Since the early 20th century, the U.S. film industry has largely been based in and around Hollywood, although in the 21st century an increasing number of films are not made there, and film companies have been subject to the forces of globalization.[499] The Academy Awards, popularly known as the Oscars, have been held annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences since 1929,[500] and the Golden Globe Awards have been held annually since January 1944.[501]\n",
      "The industry enjoyed its golden years, in what is commonly referred to as the \"Golden Age of Hollywood\", from the early sound period until the early 1960s,[502] with screen actors such as John Wayne and Marilyn Monroe becoming iconic figures.[503][504] In the 1970s, \"New Hollywood\" or the \"Hollywood Renaissance\"[505] was defined by grittier films influenced by French and Italian realist pictures of the post-war period.[506] The 21st century was marked by the rise of American streaming platforms, which came to rival traditional cinema.[507][508]\n",
      "Early settlers were introduced by Native Americans to foods such as turkey, sweet potatoes, corn, squash, and maple syrup. Of the most enduring and pervasive examples are variations of the native dish called succotash. Early settlers and later immigrants combined these with foods they were familiar with, such as wheat flour,[509] beef, and milk to create a distinctive American cuisine.[510][511] New World crops, especially pumpkin, corn, potatoes, and turkey as the main course are part of a shared national menu on Thanksgiving, when many Americans prepare or purchase traditional dishes to celebrate the occasion.[512]\n",
      "Characteristic American dishes such as apple pie, fried chicken, doughnuts, french fries, macaroni and cheese, ice cream, pizza, hamburgers, and hot dogs derive from the recipes of various immigrant groups.[513][514][515][516] Mexican dishes such as burritos and tacos preexisted the United States in areas later annexed from Mexico, and adaptations of Chinese cuisine as well as pasta dishes freely adapted from Italian sources are all widely consumed.[517] American chefs have had a significant impact on society both domestically and internationally. In 1946, the Culinary Institute of America was founded by Katharine Angell and Frances Roth. This would become the United States' most prestigious culinary school, where many of the most talented American chefs would study prior to successful careers.[518][519]\n",
      "The United States restaurant industry was projected at $899 billion in sales for 2020,[520][521] and employed more than 15 million people, representing 10% of the nation's workforce directly.[520] It is the country's second-largest private employer and the third-largest employer overall.[522][523] The United States is home to over 220 Michelin Star rated restaurants, 70 of which are in New York City alone.[524] Wine has been produced in what is now the United States since the 1500s, with the first widespread production beginning in what is now New Mexico in 1628.[525][526][527] Today, wine production is undertaken in all fifty states, with California producing 84 percent of all US wine. With more than 1,100,000 acres (4,500Â km2) under vine, the United States is the fourth-largest wine producing country in the world, after Italy, Spain, and France.[528][529]\n",
      "The American fast-food industry, the world's first and largest, pioneered the drive-through format in the 1940s[530] and is often viewed as being a symbol of U.S. marketing dominance. American companies such as McDonald's,[531] Burger King, Pizza Hut, Kentucky Fried Chicken, and Domino's Pizza, among many others, have numerous outlets around the world.[532]\n",
      "The most popular spectator sports in the U.S. are American football, basketball, baseball, soccer, and ice hockey.[533] While most major U.S. sports such as baseball and American football have evolved out of European practices, basketball, volleyball, skateboarding, and snowboarding are American inventions, many of which have become popular worldwide.[534] Lacrosse and surfing arose from Native American and Native Hawaiian activities that predate European contact.[535] The market for professional sports in the United States was approximately $69Â billion in July 2013, roughly 50% larger than that of all of Europe, the Middle East, and Africa combined.[536]\n",
      "American football is by several measures the most popular spectator sport in the United States;[537] the National Football League has the highest average attendance of any sports league in the world, and the Super Bowl is watched by tens of millions globally.[538] However, baseball has been regarded as the U.S. \"national sport\" since the late 19th century. After American football, the next four most popular professional team sports are basketball, baseball, soccer, and ice hockey. Their premier leagues are, respectively, the National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball, Major League Soccer, and the National Hockey League. The most-watched individual sports in the U.S. are golf and auto racing, particularly NASCAR and IndyCar.[539][540]\n",
      "On the collegiate level, earnings for the member institutions exceed $1 billion annually,[541] and college football and basketball attract large audiences, as the NCAA March Madness tournament and the College Football Playoff are some of the most watched national sporting events.[542] In the U.S., the intercollegiate sports level serves as a feeder system for professional sports. This differs greatly from practices in nearly all other countries, where publicly and privately funded sports organizations serve this function.[543]\n",
      "Eight Olympic Games have taken place in the United States. The 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis, Missouri, were the first-ever Olympic Games held outside of Europe.[544] The Olympic Games will be held in the U.S. for a ninth time when Los Angeles hosts the 2028 Summer Olympics. U.S. athletes have won a total of 2,959 medals (1,173 gold) at the Olympic Games, the most of any country.[545][546][547]\n",
      "In international competition, the U.S. men's national soccer team has qualified for eleven World Cups, while the women's national team has won the FIFA Women's World Cup and Olympic soccer tournament four times each.[548] The United States hosted the 1994 FIFA World Cup and will co-host, along with Canada and Mexico, the 2026 FIFA World Cup.[549] The 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup was also hosted by the United States. Its final match was watched by 90,185, setting the world record for most-attended women's sporting event.[550]\n",

      " In the 1970s, \"New Hollywood\" or the \"Hollywood Renaissance\"[505] was defined by grittier films influenced by French and Italian realist pictures of the post-war period.[506]\n",

      "\n",
      " Of the most enduring and pervasive examples are variations of the native dish called succotash.\n",
      "\n",
      " Early settlers and later immigrants combined these with foods they were familiar with, such as wheat flour,[509] beef, and milk to create a distinctive American cuisine.[510][511] New World crops, especially pumpkin, corn, potatoes, and turkey as the main course are part of a shared national menu on Thanksgiving, when many Americans prepare or purchase traditional dishes to celebrate the occasion.[512]\n",
      "Characteristic American dishes such as apple pie, fried chicken, doughnuts, french fries, macaroni and cheese, ice cream, pizza, hamburgers, and hot dogs derive from the recipes of various immigrant groups.[513][514][515][516] Mexican dishes such as burritos and tacos preexisted the United States in areas later annexed from Mexico, and adaptations of Chinese cuisine as well as pasta dishes freely adapted from Italian sources are all widely consumed.[517] American chefs have had a significant impact on society both domestically and internationally.\n",
      "\n",
      " In 1946, the Culinary Institute of America was founded by Katharine Angell and Frances Roth.\n",

      "The United States restaurant industry was projected at $899 billion in sales for 2020,[520][521] and employed more than 15 million people, representing 10% of the nation's workforce directly.[520]\n",

      "\n",
      " While most major U.S. sports such as baseball and American football have evolved out of European practices, basketball, volleyball, skateboarding, and snowboarding are American inventions, many of which have become popular worldwide.[534] Lacrosse and surfing arose from Native American and Native Hawaiian activities that predate European contact.[535]\n",
      "\n",
      " The market for professional sports in the United States was approximately $69Â billion in July 2013, roughly 50% larger than that of all of Europe, the Middle East, and Africa combined.[536]\n",
      "American football is by several measures the most popular spectator sport in the United States;[537] the National Football League has the highest average attendance of any sports league in the world, and the Super Bowl is watched by tens of millions globally.[538]\n",
      "\n",
      " However, baseball has been regarded as the U.S. \"national sport\" since the late 19th century.\n",
      "\n",
      " After American football, the next four most popular professional team sports are basketball, baseball, soccer, and ice hockey.\n",
